          The main focus of the course is on the interconnection of SE+AI and
          how these topics apply for AI-based systems. For example, issues
          related to CI/CD during development while handling large training data
          and managing model evolution and tracking accuracy as the AI-based
          software systems evolve are unique aspects that will be covered in
          this course. As part of the course, trainees will conduct a hands-on
          project with our industrial partners where they will exercise the
          theory learned in the course. Trainees will have the option to either
          study an existing AI-based system or develop a new system as part of
          the project. Trainees will prepare case reports about their projects.
          The prepared cases will be used in following years to enrich our
          training and will be disseminated to the international community.

          Although the course will mainly focus on the engineering of AI-based
          systems, trainees will be asked to reflect on the social aspects and
          how they influenced the engineering aspects of the system.

          A newly developed course that focuses on various social criteria that
          AI-based systems need to consider, e.g., privacy, ethics, equity,
          diversity, inclusion (EDI), human rights and sustainable development
          goals (SDG). Trainees will be introduced to the fundamental theories,
          normative frameworks and ethical concepts and will learn to apply them
          on AI-based systems. To gain applied knowledge on the concepts they
          are taught, trainees will be provided with existing AI-based systems,
          or can use their projects from the Engineering AI-based Software
          Systems course, and will be asked to write a report on these systems.
          The reports will examine the various social aspects of the system
          being studied and report on how these aspects have been considered (or
          not) in the studied systems. Trainees will be asked to come up with an
          ethical assessment and concrete recommendations for such systems,
          while considering the engineering implications of their
          recommendations.

        Specialized modules that focus on professional

         to trainees. This includes specialized modules on professional
          skills (e.g., dissemination and presentation skills, commercialization
           and entrepreneurship, communication and explainability) and aspects
            of engagement and relation-building with communities and diverse stakeholders. 
            In addition to newly developed modules, trainees will have access to a curated 
            list of relevant professional development modules
             that fit the SE4AI CREATE program offered through the
              host universities (e.g. Concordia’s GradProSkills, Queen’s
               Smith School of Business, Centre for Teaching and Learning,
                University Research Services, and School of Graduate Studies).
                 Trainees are given full flexibility to choose the modules that 
                 better fit their expected future career aspirations 
                 (e.g., academic researcher versus entrepreneur).

          To position trainees to be successful and socially responsible leaders
          in their field the SE4AI CREATE incorporates hands-on leadership and
          mentorship training. This training is achieved through a multitude of
          mechanisms. Trainees will serve as mentors-in-training (MIT) along
          supervisors to more junior trainees. For example, PhD students and
          postdocs can serve as MITs to undergrad and MSc, and PhD trainees,
          respectively. MITs will be trained to incorporate EDI principles in
          leadership, including equity aspects in collaboration, evaluation and
          assessment (e.g. counteracting gender, racial, cultural and language
          bias), as well as equitable modes of collaboration (e.g. monitoring
          speaking time in group meeting to give everybody the opportunity to
          participate and contribute). To ensure a comprehensive training of the
          MITs, they will be given the option to mentor trainees in all aspects,
          i.e., proposing research projects, supporting progress, as well as
          advising them on technical writing, presentation, and research
          methodology issues.
